## User story
AS A person with a budding interest in astronomy (with little to no knowledge),
I WANT to find an easy-to-use website that will provide me basic information without too many buttons or confusing UI elements,
SO THAT I can learn useful information that will serve as an introduction to space knowledge.


GIVEN a website with space information,

WHEN I enter a particular date and click submit,
THEN I am shown the NASA image of the day for the day I selected.

WHEN I scroll down past the image of the day,
THEN I am shown each major body in our galaxy, in order from the sun to pluto.

WHEN I click "click for more info" beneath each planet,
THEN an area appears below with more information regarding that planet.
