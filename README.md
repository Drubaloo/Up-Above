# Up-Above
"Showing the brilliance of the night sky in an ever-expanding universe."

**Proposal**
Up Above is an app that tells you what planets, stars, and constellations are above either a specified location, or the users current location. It provides the user with their current coordinates and gives them information about the celestial bodies above a specified location. 


**Task allocation**
